    // Let's say we have an array


    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
  /*
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);
    */

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    players[3] = 'Lux'
      // players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']
      // team = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']
        //team is a reference to the original array "players" so when you update an array, it will always reference back and the changes are reflected in both

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead! If nothing is passed into slice, it will make a copy
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'new person';
    console.log(team4);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy - the original referenced array is updated:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
        //Object.assign() Takes a blank object, the object that you'd like to take properties/values from, and the third argument are whatever additional properties you'd like to add to the new object.

    // Object spread, which works the same way as you spread into an array.
    const cap3 = {...person}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    //Creates a copy of the object, if dev.name is updated, only the name is updated on the dev ojbect, not the wes object

    //HOWEVER, if you update the nested social object on the dev Object - dev.social.twitter = '@coolman' then wes.social.twitter will also be updated. When you use Object.assign() it only does one level deep. If you need deeper cloning, you'll need to use a cloneDeep function (find online). Very rarely do you need to clone an object that deep, so ask yourself "should I be doing this, is there a better way?" prior to using.

    //Poor man's deep clone - NOT SUGGESTED - const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
        //What this does - a object is passed into JSON.stringify which converts the object to a string. Which is then passed into JSON.parse() and is then converted back to a full new copy of the Object
