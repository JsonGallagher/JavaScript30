    // Let's say we have an array


    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
  /*
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);
    */

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    players[3] = 'Lux'
      // players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']
      // team = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']
        //team is a reference to the original array "players" so when you update an array, it will always reference back and the changes are reflected in both

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead! If nothing is passed into slice, it will make a copy
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'new person';
    console.log(team4);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
